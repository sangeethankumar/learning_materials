## Introduction
`Numba` is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler to translate `Python` code into machine code which can often speedup. Some of its functionalities are
1. JIT compilation
2. Decorators to indicate that the function should be optimized
3. Loop optimization
4. Parallel execution to utilize multi-core processors
5. GPU acceleration
6. Interoperability with `NumPy`
